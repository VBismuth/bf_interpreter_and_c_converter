# Brainfuck interpreter and C translator

Written in python simple scripts to work with Brainfuck programs:

- *bf2c* is used to convert bf file to C with optional optimizations. Then you can compile generated c file.

- *interpreter* is for debugging purposes and quite slow. It can run code step by step and dump bf registry. It requires *getch* to be installed (`pip install getch`)

---

For command arguments of any script use `<cmd> -h`.
